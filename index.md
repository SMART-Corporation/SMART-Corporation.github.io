## SMART Corporation

The corporate world is a not a unique place.  Each company has problems that are at one instance uncommon from all other organizations at the same time similar to many others.  We at SMART Corporation partner with our clients to identify the business challenges facing their lives and assist them in solving them with the right technical solution.  We believe there is no one size fits all approach to solving business challenges by leveraging technology.  Technology for technologies sake brings no business value to the corporate world.  In order for companies to succeed, they need to work with business to define the business requirements and then figure out what technology can best solve the requirements.

At SMART Corporation, we specialize in Infrastructure (Security, Network, and Enterprise System) Architecture, Business Solutions, Performance Engineering, and Office Automation.  We work with our client’s to bring their thoughts into reality.  We have partnership with premier solution providers (off-shore as well as near-shore) to be able to provide application development.  We bring over 20 years of industry experience and best practices to make our clients gain competitive edge over their competitors.  Our knowledge in today’s technologies coupled with our past experiences, guide us to providing the targeted solution our clients so desire.

Our mission is to provide Secure, Manageable, Attainable, Repeatable, Traceable (SMARTTM) Infrastructure solution to our clients.  Our client base includes Fortune 100 companies as well as small companies.
