Remote Sensing is the acquisition of geographical, climactic, oceanographic, and other related data on a particular region of the earth using existing satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This technology was meant to establish cost-effective remote sensing stations in Venezuela and maximize the utilization of local resources to analyze the data for commercial and governmental clients. The system would aide in the successful implementation of projects in monitoring the environment, deforestation, reforestation, and pollution control.

The use of the technology is limitless.
